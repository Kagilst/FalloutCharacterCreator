This is an application I am currently developing using WPF and .NET 6.0.

The goal of this application is to make a tool that allows users to plan out characters for several games within the Fallout game series.

The current plan is to allow users to choose a game they wish to plan a character for. Then users will proceed through a character creation screen
where they will choose their starting attributes, skills, and etc. When finished they will create the character and then can proceed through a series
of player levels where they can choose their stats, perks, etc. and see the changes that will have on their character. Users will be able to go 
forwards level or back levels if they wish to change previous choices. At the end of character development after they have made all their choices
they will have the options to download a doc which will display all the steps they made so they can follow along while playing the game. That way
players can instead plan a build they know they will like and follow the guide instead of having to revert to a previous save and losing hours of 
progress when making a choice they regret in game.
